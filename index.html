            My first company, right out of college was TCS-Chennai India. Its a large company with 50,000 employees and huge sprawling campus. I worked for various US clients like Nationwide,CNA and Bank Of America.
       
             WOrking in technologies like Java/J2EE, Oracle query tuning, SQL Server, Crystal Reports was exciting. It was a great experience and I moved from Assosciate Software Engineer to Team Lead there. 
            <br> <br>

            I was doing great proffessionally but lost my first baby 3 days after birth. It was traumatic and changed the course of my life.

            <br id="testP" class=" funParagraph"> My family relocated to Us next and I had my second son, He turned one and was diagnosed with multiple health conditions (Autism).
                I was in a new country with no family support and decided to take a break from my career. I realized teh difficulty of raising a special needs child.
               <br> My son inspired me a lot with his struggles. The things that typical people take for granted, like speaking , writing etc was a humungous task for him. 
               He went through hours of therapy and treatment for autism and other health conditions.   </p>

         <h2 id="mainHeading">Coach - Autism Volunteer</h2>
         <p id="testP" class=" funParagraph"> Doctors told me that my son might never speak or fit in with typical kids. My breaking part was when kids at playground shouted out "weirdo' to him.
             His eyes showed the longing to play with those kids but none of them wanted to be near him. There were few kind kids but it could only be momenatry and not lasting.
             I could not accept this and started researching all the new clinical trials. I enrolled him in multiple studies, got in touch with researchers. I found a lot of kind souls who guided me. 
             I got really lucky and my son responded to a treatment and started talking in senetences in a week. It was a miracle! 

             I started talking to more researchers and therapists. A couple of parents with newly diagnosed kids reached out to me and I started mentoring them.
      Slowly, I was mentoring a lot of parents and my day was filled and became a full time occupation. But it was affecting me mentally, as I felt the pain personally.<a href=" https://tacanow.org/family-resources/

         <p id="testP" class=" funParagraph"> In 2017, my son was doing better and I wanted to start working in IT again. In one of the autism conferences, a friend spoke about a startup who wanted a BSA (part time) 
            and I applied for the same. The pay was quite low as they were just starting out. But I did everything there-requirements gathering,guiding the offshore developers and became fulltime in 6 months.
            I got scrum certification and acted as the scrum Master, setup Sharepoint documentation, completed Power Bi dashboards, wrote scripts for genetics modules, now working on Azure setup and AWS Textract(ID). 
            
            <br>Now, I have a hybrid role with multiple resposibilities that I love.

         <p id="testP" class=" funParagraph">
         Beginning of 2022, I started feeling the need to specialize and get into larger organization. I want to develop a set of broader skillsets than niche functional role.
         I came across Launchcode and decided to apply. After an easy intake process, here I am at Launchcode!! I hope this journey leads me to new things and broader horizons!!
